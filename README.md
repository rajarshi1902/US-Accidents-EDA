# Exploratory Data Analysis on US Road Accidents

### BY : Rajarshi Bhattacharjee

This repository contains my first ever attempt at a full scale EDA project using python and its libraries. 
Three columns of data are being used to create dist plots, histograms and kde plots to show how accident patterns change with changing parameters.
Certain interesting conclusions were found and also mentioned like:
1. Accidents are higher during the morning hours in the weekdays and during the afternoon hours during the weekends
2. Accidents tend to increase as the year comes to an end
